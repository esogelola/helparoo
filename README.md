# Inspiration

Human beings are social animals. With technology advancing, our lives are moving faster and at the same time, it’s creating a distance among us, both physically and mentally. Each of us needs a little help from our friends from time to time. What if you can get that help with just a few clicks, for free? Imagine the true power of connecting with your neighbors!

## What It Does

Helparoo is the new way to share and get the help you need even easier. Now it will just take a minute to connect with your neighbor. Now there’s no more distance mentally, so you can ask for help for anything like borrow & lend, find a ride, pet sit, stuff, etc.

## How We Built It

We wanted to build a mobile application but dislike mobile development. So we compromised and developed a fun little mobile app on the web. For our frontend, we used React, Framer Motion, Mapbox, and Sass. For our backend, we used Firebase as both our authentication and data storage.

### Technologies Used (Our Stack)

As a two-man team, we kept our tech stack light, so we could focus on completing the project.

| Stack         | Technology Used                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Front-End     | React, Figma, Javascript, Redux, Sass |
| Back-End      | Firebase                              |
| Cloud/Hosting | Netlify                               |
| Database      | Firestore                             |

## Challenges We Ran Into

When developing Helparoo we ran into some challenges when using Framer Motion & Mapbox, we had never used these libraries before and it was a lot of learning.

- Minor issues creating the mini phone
- 24 hours, 2 Man Team, Semi big idea

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

- Created an Accessible Design
- First hackathon project we've fully completed
- Came up with a really good accessibility hack

## What We Learned

Over the course of developing Helparoo for HooHacks 2022, we learned a lot about how to prioritize our time to make sure we complete projects on time and with a fully functional project.

We worked in an agile way, making sure to deliver on small goals quickly, as well as working to hold ourselves accountable. This allowed us to gather feedback quickly and make sure our project was going where we wanted it to go.

## What's next for Helparoo

As we further develop Helparoo we hope to improve on some **current implementations** and **develop additional features**:

- Create a mobile app
- Cleaner Mapbox usage
- Custom backend
